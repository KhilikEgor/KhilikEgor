## Quick "about me"

- Software Developer
- Graduate Master's degree in ITMO University on Software Engineering program


I usually **strive to challenge** myself and find creative solutions to difficult problems.   
I'm **not afraid** of a problem, I'm afraid I haven't tried enough.   
I'm a **team player** and I value people with an open mindset and willingness to create.
